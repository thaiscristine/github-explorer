# Welcome github_explorer!

Hi! This is an exciting exercise that I did to improve my skills using ReactJs and TypeScript.

## Installation

Use the package manager [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/install/#:~:text=yarn%20install%20is%20used%20to,save%20or%20%2D%2Dsave%2Ddev%20.) to install github_explorer packages.

`yarn install`

## Usage

Great! Now to run the application you just need to run on terminal  the followed command:

`yarn start`

(Note: You want to be in the application folder before running the command)
